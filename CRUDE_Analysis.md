# CRUDE Analysis

- Helps to identify object collaborations
- Labels object interaction in 5 possible ways:
  - **C**reate—can one object create another?
  - **R**ead—can one object read the attributes of another?
  - **U**pdate—can one object change values in another?
  - **D**elete—can one object delete another object?
  - **E**xecute—can one object execute the operations of another?
- Utilizes a matrix to represent objects and their interactions
- Most useful as a system-wide representation
